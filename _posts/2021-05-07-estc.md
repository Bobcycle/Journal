**Comments**

One of the trades I'm more fond of. Thus far, I have missed out on chances which hit historic or yearly support. In this case we have ESTC hitting yearly support on multiple points. With a hammer (signaling a reversal) on daily. Only negative is that this looks like a head and shoulders pattern which indicates a continuation. However the hammer and the igniting volume makes me confident that this one will reverse in the right direction over the few coming days.

**Observed**

I was very fond of this trade. Many things went wrong. Mainly started when I fat-fingered a number and got filled at 109.71 instead of 106.51 which screwed up my risk management. Other than that I have also lost 2.6R on this trade as it gapped my stop-loss, sigh.

**Things to bare in mind**

- Double check the entry (you have time as I am swing-trading) before pushing buy.
- If I get filled at the wrong price look to exit the position as soon at any given chance.
