| Stop  | Entry | Target | Shares | Risk |

**Comment**
-- I took this trade as part of my new trading strategy which is in development. I'm not sure if I should have entered at hourly resistance at ~90 in this case. As I took the trade on mainly daily, should it matter?

**Thing(s) to bare in mind**
-- Wondering if the trade should have been taken at resistance on hourly, should it have been above?
-- I'm testing out risk with 50$ instead of my original value as stop losses got hit quickly.
