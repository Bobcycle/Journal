title: Increased risk with more market volatility
---

The management of risk is an important (if not the most) job of anyone who takes their trading seriously. Without proper risk management anyone will become an ex-trader very quickly.

When it comes to [retail traders](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/030515/what-difference-between-institutional-traders-and-retail-traders.asp) the most common risk management techniques are stop losses and working with risk units. Whilst some might even go as far as to [hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp). This is a more advanced method for seasoned traders who, for example, trade for a living.

One aspect which does not get mentioned enough is the increased risk during above average market [volatility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp#:~:text=Volatility%20is%20a%20statistical%20measure,same%20security%20or%20market%20index.). Your risk increases automatically, especially when managing a portfolio.

> Volatility does create immense opportunity, especially for day/swing-traders, but it will also force you to think about your exposure to the market.

If the average market volatility is 0.50% on an asset with a $1.000.000 portfolio you will either win or lose $5.000 a day during normal market volatility.

(1.000.000 x 0,005 = 5.000)â €

However, if for some reason the market volatility doubles (1.0%) you are automatically prone to lose double the amount. You have now increased your risk by 100% by doing nothing.

*You can only combat this by halving your exposure to the market.*

During meetings with professional traders, the manager may ask their traders to sell half of their assets during increased volatility. They would have to sell $500.000 worth of assets if they have a $1.000.000 position. This again comes back to risk management being a top priority.
