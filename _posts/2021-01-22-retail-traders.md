title: Retail traders affecting stock prices

---

There have been numerous of times where I have used the argument to use the interest of [retail traders](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/030515/what-difference-between-institutional-traders-and-retail-traders.asp) (your average joe) as an indicator to liquidate or not.

If your grandparents or others in your vicinity talk about stocks (who normally don't) this could be a good *indication* to sell your stocks as a reversal may be likely.

*In the year 1929, [Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy_Sr.) sold all of his stock just before the market crash of that year. He got out of the market because he received stock tips from a shoe-shine boy.*

In this case, Joseph took it as a warning and immediately acted upon it, saving himself. It is a genuine indicator to consider for anyone who does analysis on stocks.

The University of Berkeley has researched this exact phenomenon. In 2009 they have published [their study](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/Papers%20current%20versions/DoRetailTradesMoveMarkets_RFS_2009.pdf?abstract_id=869827) about the potential of retail traders being able to affect stock prices.

In this case, their conclusion was that over short time horizons (days or weeks) retail traders have a direct influence on the market, pushing or pulling prices.

> Over short horizons, retail trades move stock prices.

When we look at longer time horizons - yearly - retail traders do have an influence. However, particularly on small cap stocks. These are companies which have a value below $2 billion dollars. In essence, the smaller the company over longer horizons, the more influence.
