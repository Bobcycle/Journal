**Comments**

I'm loving the support here. It has multiple retests and it has held thus far. Would have loved to see a hammer to confirm the trade. Going with half my exposure on this one as I want to see how this one turns out for future backtesting.

**Observed**

Nice pivot trade. I took the trade mainly on hourly support knowing that it will eventually break resistance and that it was only a matter of time knowing this stock.

**Things to bare in mind**

- Would have loved to see more confirmation such as a hammer on support.
