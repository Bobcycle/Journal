**Comments**

I took this trade as part of my new trading strategy which is in development. I'm not sure if I should have entered at hourly resistance at ~90 in this case. As I took the trade on the daily timeframe, should it matter? I need more trades to back test with.

**Observed**

Nice retest on rising channel with hammer on daily signaling a potential reverse. 
Rising channel has been retested thrice in the past without it breaking.

**Things to bare in mind**

- Wondering if the trade shouldn't have been taken at resistance on hourly.
- I'm testing out risk with 50$ instead of my original value as stop losses got hit quickly.
