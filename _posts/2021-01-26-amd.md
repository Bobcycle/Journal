**Comments**

This is quite a textbook pivot trade. It is actually my best trade so far (when looking at risk to reward ratio) to this day. I have made almost 3R on this trade as I risked $30.58. Does that mean I broke my trading plan and that I always have to stick to 3R?

**Observed**

Nice pivot trade. I took the trade mainly on hourly support knowing that it will eventually break resistance and that it was only a matter of time knowing this stock.

**Things to bare in mind**

- Did I break my trading plan for going for a 3R play on AMD?
- More risky trade as I traded during earnings, but I did lower my risk.
